\section{Demo Overview} \label{sec:demo} 
In our demo, we will show our prototype implementation of a system equipped with smart drill-down. We have included two datasets, a marketing survey, and the US Census, which users can explore using smart drill-down. We will have three demonstration scenarios:

\squishlist
\item {\bf Comparison to drill-down}: We will have some canned exploration scenarios where we demonstrate how smart drill down lets one discover interesting information about a table efficiently. These scenarios will highlight the advantage of smart drill down compared with traditional drill down. 
\item {\bf Rule Finder Parameters}: We will allow the user to vary parameters shown in the user interface, and observe their effects on the rules displayed, as well as the response time and accuracy. For instance, using smaller values for max weight will speed up the response, but a very small value will result in the user seeing an unoptimal table summary. Using a different weighting function, such as `Bits' will prioritize columns with a larger number of distinct values.
\item {\bf Sample Handler Parameters}: We will allow users to try out instances of the system with different values of $minSS$ and let them observe the resulting effects on response time and accuracy.
